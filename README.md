# Data Manipulation in Pandas

## Overview
This project showcases data manipulation techniques using the Pandas library in Python. The primary focus is on loading, filtering, and analyzing data from a CSV file. Key operations include handling missing values and calculating statistical summaries.

## Project Details

### Data Source
A CSV file containing relevant data to be manipulated and analyzed.

### Key Operations
- **Loading Data**: Importing the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation.
- **Filtering Data**: Utilizing various methods to filter and subset the data according to specified criteria.
- **Handling Missing Values**: Implementing strategies to identify and manage missing data to ensure data integrity.
- **Calculating Summary Statistics**: Aggregating data to produce meaningful insights, including counts, means, medians, and other relevant statistics.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Pandas library (install via pip if not already installed)

```bash
pip install pandas
```

### Usage Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

   ```bash
   cd pandas-data-manipulation
   ```

3. Run the Python script to execute the data operations.

   ```bash
   python Task-2.py
   ```

### Example Functionality
After executing the script, you will see the output of filtered data, along with summary statistics printed to the console. Modify the filtering criteria within the script to customize the analysis based on your needs.

## Conclusion
This project serves as a foundation for more complex data manipulation tasks in Python using Pandas. By mastering these techniques, you will enhance your data analysis capabilities and facilitate better decision-making through data-driven insights.
